# JpegDelete

Many photographers shoot in RAW+Jpeg mode, sometimes shoot in Jpeg mode, sometimes only Raw, the Lightroom can not delete the jpeg file but keep the raw with just one key down, and I don't think I want to do this one by one...by hand, this tool solves the problem, just drag the Lightroom folder in, it will delete all the jpeg file while the raw file exists.

a 45MP jpeg file with (large, fine) from Nikon D850 takes about 26MB, means about 130GB with 5000 shoots, that is huge with expensive SSD drivers.

so delete them, just drag the Lightroom folder in and it will be done in seconds.

### usage
just drag the Lightroom or the picture folder in.

**warning**: it starts to work immediately, no ask or alert, a backup is suggested.

### requirement
macOS 10.10
